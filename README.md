# Components in Vue

Now, that's it for the Vue router.

You’ve learned a lot in this repo:

- **Why we need routing** and how to set up routing.
- How to **register routes** and the various configuration options available:
  - Setting up **redirects**, paths, names, metadata.
  - Loading **multiple components**.
  - **Nested routes** with child components.
- Working with **dynamic path segments** and **route parameters**:
  - Extracting route parameters in loaded components.
  - Passing route parameters as **props** to components.
- Exploring **navigation guards** and controlling **scroll behavior**.
- Navigating with **router-link** or programmatically with the `$router` property and `push` method.
- Defining locations by:
  - **String paths** or objects with names.
  - Adding **params** and **query parameters**.

With these skills, you can:

- Enhance the user experience by preserving **unsaved changes**.
- Ensure URLs are meaningful and **sharable**, relating to on-screen content.
- Support **single-page application (SPA)** navigation while making the app shareable and bookmarkable.

These are the fundamentals we’ve covered here. Revisit this repo if anything feels unclear, or as a refresher in a few weeks. The Vue router is essential for any larger application you’ll build.

And speaking of larger applications, we’ll soon dive into building one, where we’ll apply all of these concepts and see the Vue router in action in a realistic, robust project.
