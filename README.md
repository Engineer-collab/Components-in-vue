# 🚀 Components in Vue

> **Now, that's it for the Vue Router!**

You’ve learned a lot in this repo:

- 🎯 **Why we need routing** and how to set up routing.
- 🛠️ How to **register routes** and the various configuration options available:
  - 📌 Setting up **redirects**, paths, names, metadata.
  - 🔄 Loading **multiple components**.
  - 🔗 **Nested routes** with child components.
- 🔍 Working with **dynamic path segments** and **route parameters**:
  - Extracting route parameters in loaded components.
  - Passing route parameters as **props** to components.
- 🛡️ Exploring **navigation guards** and controlling **scroll behavior**.
- 🌐 Navigating with **router-link** or programmatically with the `$router` property and `push` method.
- ✨ Defining locations by:
  - **String paths** or objects with names.
  - Adding **params** and **query parameters**.

With these skills, you can:

- ✅ Enhance the user experience by preserving **unsaved changes**.
- 🔗 Ensure URLs are meaningful and **sharable**, relating to on-screen content.
- 💻 Support **single-page application (SPA)** navigation while making the app shareable and bookmarkable.
